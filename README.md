# IBM-Analysing-Data-with-Python
In this course, I was introduced to the basics of data analysis with Python in order to build and evaluate data models. I imported data from many sources, cleaned and wrangled the data, performed exploratory data analysis, and created insightful data visualisations.

Additionally, I created linear, multiple, and polynomial regression models to determine future trends, and learnt how to analyse these models.

I used many Python libraries, such as Pandas and NumPy to load, manipulate, analyse, and visualise data. I also worked with SciPy and scikit-learn, to build the machine learning models to predict the future trends.
